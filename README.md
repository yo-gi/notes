Agent issue: Model passing in "string": "[Object object]" to the run code tool - TMG

- [ ] Pass entity ids and model names and whatnot from backend to frontend
- [ ] voice x main agent - support extraction -- this is setup for that
- [ ] Verify gemini results

I should probably put unbounded tasks at the end of the day unless they're incredibly important.
By that logic Gemini would be at the end.

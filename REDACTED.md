Apologies, following up on this, I think we talked about some of this on the weekly today but update on the general situation -

We'll want to do some editor changes to accomodate the file system+new capabilities, fix existing pain points

- Simple view that shows files available to the agent
  - Uploading SOP, reference docs, etc.
- Getting rid of embedded tools in the editor (since we're removing tools from the agent, MDX has caused many issues)

Unfortunately we lost some time because a lot of the initial design exploration we did with Darek is based working with the old agent and I don't think its applicable in the new world. We have reset him on the new set of requirements.

I think the biggest unlock for agents out of the box will be enabling the "chat with your SOP" feature. If we can get to some kind of "claude code for insurance workflows" type feeling - where users just ask for changes and they happen, I think that would be big and is currently what I'm guiding the project towards.

Kim is working on on the editor experience and I'm working on getting the agent off the ground.
